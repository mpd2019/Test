<h2 style="text-align: center;">Audiometry Hearing Test</h2>
<p>Tinnitus is a noise and hearing sounds of the person with it, perhaps in one or both ears, dragon ear is a very common problem as the tinnitus is based on about 15 to 20 percent of people, and in America only there are more than 50 million people who have tinnitus Ear, which is approximately 15% of the American population, tinnitus is not a disease in itself but rather a symptom of another condition, such as age-related hearing loss, ear injury, or a circulatory disorder</p>
<p>Although disturbing, tinnitus is not a sign of something serious. Although it can be aggravated with age.</p>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">Buzzing sound</h6>
<p>Tinnitus involves the sensation of a sound that the person can only hear when there is no external sound. Tinnitus symptoms may include these types of phantom noise in your ears.</p>
<ul>
    <ol>Ringing.</ol>
    <ol>Whistle.</ol>
    <ol>Hadeer.</ol>
    <ol>Clicks.</ol>
    <ol>hiss.</ol>
    <ol>The sound of a tea.</ol>
    <ol>kettle.</ol>
    <ol>Airplane engine.</ol>
    <ol>sound.</ol>
    <ol>And others.</ol>

        </ul>
<p>Phantom noise in pitch may vary from low roar to loud squeaking, and you may hear it in one or both ears. In some cases, the sound can be so loud that it may interfere with your ability to focus or hear the outside sound The tinnitus may be present all the time, or it may come and go.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Types of tinnitus</h3>
<p>Self-tinnitus It is only a buzz that the injured person can hear. This is the most common type of tinnitus. It can be caused by problems in the outer, middle, or inner ear that can also be caused by problems with the auditory nerves or part of your brain that interprets nerve signals as sound of auditory pathwaysThematic tinnitusIt is a tinnitus that your doctor can hear when performing the examination. This rare type of tinnitus may be caused by a problem with the blood vessels, middle ear bone condition, or muscle cramps.</p>
<h3>When do you see a doctor?</h3>
<p>If you have tinnitus bothering you, see your doctor
    Tinnitus develops after an upper respiratory infection, such as a cold, and if the tinnitus continues, see your doctor as soon as possible.
   If you have tinnitus that occurs suddenly or for no apparent reason
    If you suffer from hearing loss or dizziness with tinnitus.</p>
<h3>the reasons</h3>

<p>A number of health conditions can cause or worsen tinnitus. In many cases an exact cause has never been found

    A common cause of tinnitus is damage to the capillary nerve cells in the inner ear. Small and thin hairs move in your inner ear according to the sound waves it brings. This causes the cells to release an electrical signal through the auditory nerve from your ear to your brain. Your brain interprets these signals as sound. If the capillaries inside the inner ear are bent or broken, they can "leak" random electrical impulses into your brain, causing tinnitus
    
    Other causes of tinnitus include other ear problems, chronic health conditions, injuries or conditions affecting the nerves in your ear or the hearing center of your brain.</p>
    <h3>Common causes of tinnitus</h3>
    <p>In many people, tinnitus occurs due to one of these conditions

        Age-related hearing loss
        For many people, hearing worsens with age, and it usually begins around the age of sixty. Hearing loss can cause tinnitus. The medical term for this type of hearing loss is aging
        
        Exposure to loud noise
         Loud noises, such as from heavy equipment, chain saws and firearms, are common sources of noise-related hearing loss. Portable music devices, such as iPod and MP3 audio players, can cause noise noise hearing if played out loud for long periods of time.
         Tinnitus caused by short-term exposure, such as attending a loud concert, usually disappears, but short-term and long-term exposure to loud sound can cause permanent damage
        
        Earwax blockage
         Earwax protects the ear canal by trapping dirt and slowing the growth of bacteria. When a lot of earwax accumulates, it becomes very difficult to wash them naturally, causing hearing loss or irritation of the eardrum, which may lead to tinnitus.
        
        Stiffening of the ear bones
         Bone stiffness in the middle ear (ear stiffness) may affect hearing and cause tinnitus. This condition, caused by abnormal bone growth, tends to spread in families
        
        Drum piercing
        It is very possible that the perforation of the eardrum causes tinnitus in the affected ear and is treated by patching the drum if it does not heal during a period determined by the doctor according to the size of the hole.
        </p>
        <h3>Other causes of tinnitus</h3>
        <p>Tinnitus can be an early indication of Menier's disease, which is a disorder in the inner ear
            It may be caused by abnormal pressure of the inner ear fluid
          TMJ disorders. Problems with the temporomandibular joint, the joint on each side of your head in front of your ears, where the lower jaw bone meets the skull, can buzz
          Head or neck injuries. Head or neck shock can affect the inner ear, auditory nerves, or brain functions associated with hearing. These injuries usually cause tinnitus in only one ear
          Auditory nerve and other causes</p>

          <h3>treatment</h3>
          <p>Unfortunately, there is no final treatment for tinnitus except for minor cases and through the treatment of etiology
            For example if the cause of tinnitus is earwax, you can treat by going to the doctor and cleaning the wax by suction using a special device or expelling it with warm water
              If you have an ear infection, your doctor will prescribe medications to treat it, and the tinnitus will disappear
             Surgery may be necessary in rare cases of a tumor, cyst, or hardening of the ear (which is a store of calcium on the bone of the ear) or patching of the eardrum
              If the tinnitus is due to the temporomandibular joint syndrome, a herniated disc that connects the skull to the lower jaw directly in front of the ear on the side of the face.
            
              Medicines to treat tinnitus
             For some, treatment with low doses of anti-anxiety medications, such as valium or antidepressants, such as: elafil, helps in reducing tinnitus, as well as using steroid in the middle ear with anti-anxiety medication.
            
             Retriever technique for tinnitus
             It is through which proportionality is achieved with hearing the same sounds, by accustoming the brain to hearing the same sounds heard by the injured person.
            
            There are also other ways to relieve or treat some conditions, such as using Chinese needles or using some nutritional supplement, such as the ginkgo plant
            
            But the best remedy for tinnitus is to cope with the disease by forgetting it, lacking stress and anxiety
            It is not dangerous, it is only annoying and may disappear in some cases without warning.</p>

                Q / I feel an increase in my tinnitus level after using this application
                C / Correct, some people may experience a marked increase in the level of tinnitus they have after using this application due to stress and focus on the subject of tinnitus during the examination as the best treatment currently available for the tinnitus is to ignore it and forget about it and not focus on it and we advise these to stay away from stress and tension and applications that Focus on the theme of Buzz as our app :)
